more S3 methods as survreg: model.frame, model.matrix, predict, residuals

MLE for Poly-Weibull and other poly-hazard models (make generic flexsurvpoly(base="weibull", ncause)  )
dpqr for poly-hazard, dpolyhaz(base="weibull", ncause)

stable h and H functions: desirable if do polyhazard.

time dependent hazard ratios, implemented in stpm2.

Implicit constraints in spline parameters - see Andrew Lover's example.
