Fitted probs for spline.   Fitted survival/ch/haz for all models, given covs and time vector, so can do own plots.

CIs for hazard.

Return data in plot object

ncovs, ncovs (inc cat) included in object

MLE for Poly-Weibull and other poly-hazard models (make generic flexsurvpoly(base="weibull", ncause)  )
dpqr for poly-hazard, dpolyhaz(base="weibull", ncause)

stable h and H functions

what about LR test against null model?

time dependent hazard ratios, implemented in stpm2.

Implicit constraints in spline parameters - see Andrew Lover's example.

Analytic derivatives of the log-likelihood for use in BFGS optimiser

Put on r-forge.
