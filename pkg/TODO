Mean or median of each distribution, where analytic

more S3 methods as survreg: model.frame, model.matrix, predict, residuals
model.matrix.default reads data from environment of object
see survival:::model.matrix.survreg: handle ancillary functions
check it works within functions
though survreg stores outcome and linear predictors in object anyway

MLE for Poly-Weibull and other poly-hazard models (make generic flexsurvpoly(base="weibull", ncause)  )
dpqr for poly-hazard, dpolyhaz(base="weibull", ncause)

time dependent hazard ratios, implemented in stpm2.

Implicit constraints in spline parameters - see Andrew Lover's example.
