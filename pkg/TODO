d/psurvspline and manpages

MLE for Poly-Weibull and other poly-hazard models (make generic flexsurvpoly(base="weibull", ncause)  )
dpqr for poly-hazard, dpolyhaz(base="weibull", ncause)

stable h and H functions

what about LR test against null model?

time dependent hazard ratios, implemented in stpm2.

Implicit constraints in spline parameters - see Andrew Lover's example.

Analytic derivatives of the log-likelihood for use in BFGS optimiser
